# konsole-test-serilog-sink

test creating a simple serilog sink for konsole that uses v7 alpha theming

## There's no solution file, how do I build it?

It's not meant to be "built" this is a demo project for you to copy (cut and paste) the KonsoleSink from and-or use to write your own custom Sink.

## how to run

1. git clone the project
2. `cd Sample` then `dotnet run`

dotnet run will do everything, restore packages, build and run, it's quite kool.
